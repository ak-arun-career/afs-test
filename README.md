# afs-test

## Details

This is a Vue 2 project with TS using these libraries for component setup:
```vue-class-component```
```vue-property-decorator```

## Assignments

### table row
On the "Home" page is a table, add a row to this table that displays the totals of the other rows.

### Async/Await
In the mounted function the data for the table is being fetched, edited and placed in the tableData property with a promise chain. 
Rewrite this function but instead of chaining promises use async/await to do the exact same. 

### Transfer search
On the Transfers page you find a list of financial transfers with a search bar. Make the transferlist searchable by "recordDate".

### Style the transferRow.vue component
Rework the style for this component, you can design them yourselves or do it based on these 
examples: https://freebiefy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Free-Soft-Cards-UI-Kit-Freebiefy-com-768x576.jpg

### Fix the update transfers button
